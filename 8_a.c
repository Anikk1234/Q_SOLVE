p = &x;//This line assigns the address of the variable x to the pointer p
x = 0;//This line sets the value of the variable x to 0.
while (*p = = x) {  //This is the start of a while loop. The condition *p == x checks if the value pointed to by p is equal to the value of x. If this condition is true, the loop body is executed; otherwise, the loop is exited.
*p=*p+1;// Inside the loop, the value pointed to by p is incremented by 1.
}

//Now, let's consider the loop:

    //Initially, x is set to 0, and p points to the address of x.
    //The condition *p == x is true because the value at the memory location pointed to by p (which is the value of x) is initially set to 0.
    //Inside the loop, *p (the value of x) is incremented by 1.

//The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition *p == x remains true. Since the loop increments the value of x in each iteration, and x is initially 0, the loop will continue indefinitely, never exiting.

//In summary, the given code fragment creates an infinite loop that increments the value of x by 1 in each iteration while *p is equal to the current value of x. However, this code has an issue that leads to an infinite loop, and it does not have a termination condition.
